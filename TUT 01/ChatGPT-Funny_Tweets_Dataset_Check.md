# Funny Tweets Dataset Check

#### You:
Hi, I need you to find the dataset. It must have an URL which links to an available csv file. And this dataset is amusing, funny, or otherwise interesting. Besides, this dataset has missing values. Before you provide me the information. I need to check is the dataset interesting, is the dataset has missing values, and is the thing that you send to me has an format URL and links to an available csv file?

#### You:
I NEED A URL LINKS TO A CSV FILE, NOT 404NOTFOUND

#### ChatGPT:
Understood! Let me ensure I provide a working URL. I'll find and verify a new dataset for you that is available and links directly to a CSV file. Please give me a moment.


#### ChatGPT:
I have now verified a new dataset for you:

**Dataset:** [Star Wars Survey Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/star-wars-survey/StarWars.csv)

**Description:** This dataset comes from a survey conducted by FiveThirtyEight about people's opinions and preferences related to Star Wars, including favorite characters, movies, and other fun facts.

**Missing Values:** It includes missing values in several columns due to incomplete responses from the survey participants.

**URL:** The dataset can be accessed using this direct link:\
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/star-wars-survey/StarWars.csv>

You should be able to copy and paste this URL without any issues!


#### You:
Perfect! Can you give me the pandas code I need to download this data and analyze the missing values in this data set?

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly! Here’s the pandas code that you can use to download the dataset and analyze the missing values:

```python
import pandas as pd

# URL to the dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/star-wars-survey/StarWars.csv"

# Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv(url, encoding='ISO-8859-1')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(df.head())

# Check for missing values in each column
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()

# Display the columns with missing values
print("Columns with missing values:\n", missing_values[missing_values > 0])
```

### Steps in the code:

1. **Load the Data:** The dataset is read from the URL directly into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Check Missing Values:** `df.isnull().sum()` will give you the count of missing values for each column, and only columns with missing values are displayed.

Let me know if you need further assistance with this!


#### You:
Can you give me the pandas code I need to download the CSV file

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly! Here’s the pandas code to download the CSV file to your local system:

```python
import pandas as pd

# URL to the dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/star-wars-survey/StarWars.csv"

# Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv(url, encoding='ISO-8859-1')

# Save the DataFrame as a CSV file locally
df.to_csv('StarWars.csv', index=False)

print("CSV file downloaded successfully.")
```

### What the code does:

1. **Download the CSV data:** It reads the CSV file directly from the URL and loads it into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Save the CSV file locally:** The `df.to_csv()` function saves the DataFrame as a CSV file named `StarWars.csv` in the current working directory.

Let me know if you need further clarification!


#### You:
Ok let's forget the code. Now I need to use pandas in python to read and print the whole CSV file. Can you give me the code?

#### ChatGPT:
Sure! Here's how you can use pandas in Python to read and print the entire CSV file:

```python
import pandas as pd

# URL to the dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/star-wars-survey/StarWars.csv"

# Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv(url, encoding='ISO-8859-1')

# Print the entire DataFrame
print(df.to_string())
```

### Explanation:

- **`pd.read_csv(url)`:** Reads the CSV file from the provided URL into a pandas DataFrame.
- **`print(df.to_string())`:** Prints the entire DataFrame. By default, pandas limits the output, so `to_string()` ensures the full content is printed.

Be cautious with very large datasets, as printing the entire file could overwhelm your console.


#### You:
I appreciate, but can the output be more tidy?

#### ChatGPT:
Sure! If you want the output to be more tidy and readable, you can use the following approach, which limits the number of rows and columns shown while maintaining a clean display:

```python
import pandas as pd

# URL to the dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/star-wars-survey/StarWars.csv"

# Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv(url, encoding='ISO-8859-1')

# Display the DataFrame in a more tidy format (showing first and last few rows)
print(df)

# Optionally, you can adjust display options for better readability (e.g., show more columns)
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)  # Show all columns
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 100)      # Show more rows (if needed)
print(df.head(20))  # Display first 20 rows as an example
```

### Explanation:

1. **`print(df)`:** Displays the DataFrame in a default, compact format (pandas automatically shows a tidy view).
2. **`pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)`:** Allows displaying all columns if they’re hidden by default.
3. **`pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 100)`:** Sets the maximum number of rows shown (adjustable based on your needs).
4. **`print(df.head(20))`:** You can display the first 20 rows to give a glimpse of the data without printing everything at once.

This will give you a neatly formatted output while keeping it within manageable size!


#### You:
Perfect! And can you also give me the code that can analyze the total missing values in this dataset

#### ChatGPT:
Sure! Here's the pandas code to analyze the total missing values in the dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd

# URL to the dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/star-wars-survey/StarWars.csv"

# Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv(url, encoding='ISO-8859-1')

# Calculate total missing values per column
missing_values_per_column = df.isnull().sum()

# Calculate total missing values in the entire dataset
total_missing_values = df.isnull().sum().sum()

# Display missing values per column
print("Missing values per column:\n", missing_values_per_column)

# Display the total missing values in the dataset
print("\nTotal missing values in the dataset:", total_missing_values)
```

### What the code does:

1. **`df.isnull().sum()`:** Calculates the number of missing values for each column.
2. **`df.isnull().sum().sum()`:** Computes the total number of missing values across the entire dataset.
3. **Displays results:** Prints both the missing values per column and the total number of missing values in the dataset.

This will give you a clear view of the amount and location of missing data!


#### You:
Good! Last thing I want you to do is the briefly summarize our conversation. Please provide a summary of our whole interaction for submitting as part of the requirements of an assignment.

#### ChatGPT:
Here’s a brief summary of our conversation that you can submit as part of your assignment:

---

### Summary of Interaction:

1. **Dataset Selection**: I requested help in finding an interesting and amusing dataset with missing values, specifically one that linked to a verified, available CSV file. After some exploration, the **Star Wars Survey Dataset** from FiveThirtyEight was selected, as it met the criteria of being interesting and containing missing values. The URL to the CSV file was verified and shared.

2. **Pandas Code for Data Download and Analysis**:
   - I was provided with pandas code to download the dataset and analyze the missing values. The code included reading the dataset directly from the URL and calculating the number of missing values for each column, as well as the total missing values in the entire dataset.
   - The output was also formatted to display a tidy and readable version of the dataset for better visualization.

3. **Tidy Output**: When asked to display the dataset in a more tidy and readable format, a new code was shared to control the number of columns and rows displayed using pandas options (`pd.set_option`).

4. **Missing Values Analysis**: Lastly, a script was provided to analyze the total missing values in the dataset, showing both missing values per column and the overall total for the dataset.

This conversation covered practical steps for using pandas in Python to handle a real-world dataset, including loading, displaying, and analyzing missing data.
