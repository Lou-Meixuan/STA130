    "### 01.\n",
    "In Python, tuple(), list(), and dict() represent different data structures, each with unique characteristics regarding mutability and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **tuple():** \n",
    "An ordered, immutable collection of items. Once the tuple was created, the elements cannot be modified (no addition, removal, or reassignment of elements) and it will maintain the order of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **list():** \n",
    "An ordered, mutable collection of items. We can modify the list by adding, removing, or changing elements, and it will maintain the order of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_list = [1, 2, 3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_list.append(4)  # Now [1, 2, 3, 4]`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **dict():** \n",
    "An ordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. You can modify the dictionary by adding, removing, or changing key-value pairs. Each item in a dictionary has a key and a corresponding value, and keys must be immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}`\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_dict['age'] = 31  # Now {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 31}`\n",
    "\n",
    "*Maintaining order:* \"Maintaining order\" in the context of data structures means that elements are stored and retrieved in the same sequence in which they were added. If a data structure maintains order, the items will always appear in the same order you originally inserted them when you iterate over them or access them."
